# api-rest-sequelize

this Api was created for testing advantages of sequelize as ORM with nodeJs and Express for backend. I cover migrations, creation tables, dynamic config for multi stage API (development, qa and production).

## Development server

Run `npm run start-dev` for a dev server and listen for port 3000.

## Dependecies

Run `npm install` for install all dependencies

## Migrations

Run with sequelize CLI for running all migration you need for create DB.
